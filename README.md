# jarcommander

A simple created window interface for beginners in Java to easily export System.out/System.in based projects with a prepackaged Swing GUI.

First Log: Okay, f*ckers! I finally got this to work in Eclipse, even with all the files and stuff!

<h2>Usage</h2>

 - Move the source code to the IDE of your choice.
 - Import the package's CommandFrame and activate it.

```
import io.github.cappycot.jarcmdr.CommandFrame;

public class Sample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        CommandFrame.activate();
        /* Follow with your code here. */
    }
}
```
